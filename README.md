For parallel computing course | Math UI

This is repo contains program for parallel computing course. Languages used in this repo are C and Python. For the parallel program, we use OpenMP and MPI for the C program, and PyMP and mpi4py for the python program.

Programs: 
- Hello World in C
- Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (Sequential and Paralel)
- Matrix-Vector Multiplication (Sequential and Paralel)
- Riemann Integral for Pi Calculation (OpenMP and MPI, Sequential & Paralel)
- Monte Carlo Simulation Sequential & Paralel (PyMP)
- Image Convolution: Gaussian Blurring (Sequential and Paralel)
